# Cross-Lingual-and-Multilingual-Language-Modeling:-
**Cross lingual classification**:-Cross-lingual classification is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves training a machine learning model to classify text or data in one language and then applying that model to classify text or data in another language, even if the model has not been specifically trained on data in the target language. This task is important because it allows NLP systems to work across multiple languages without the need to develop separate models for each language, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Here we have trained the model on Khmer language by spliting the dataset into training and test set, train the model using Dense layers.
