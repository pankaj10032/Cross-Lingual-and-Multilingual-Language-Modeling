# Cross-Lingual-and-Multilingual-Language-Modeling:-
# **Cross lingual classification**:
-Cross-lingual classification is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves training a machine learning model to classify text or data in one language and then applying that model to classify text or data in another language, even if the model has not been specifically trained on data in the target language. This task is important because it allows NLP systems to work across multiple languages without the need to develop separate models for each language, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Here we have trained the model on Khmer language by spliting the dataset into training and test set, train the model using Dense layers, achieve an accuracy of 0.7250 on classification.

# **Cross lingual text Similarity:-**
Cross-lingual text similarity is the task of measuring the similarity or similarity score between two pieces of text written in different languages. This is a valuable task in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval because it allows us to compare and find relationships between text documents in different languages. Here are some key aspects and techniques related to cross-lingual text similarity:

*Challenges in cross lingual text similarity:-*
Vocabulary Differences: Different languages have distinct vocabularies, which can make direct word matching ineffective.
Structural Differences: Syntax and grammar vary across languages, affecting sentence and document structure.
Semantic Variability: Words or phrases in one language may not have exact equivalents in another, leading to differences in meaning.

*Techniques for Cross-lingual text similarity:-*
Translation-Based Approaches: One common approach is to translate text from one language to another and then apply monolingual text similarity techniques. This can be done using machine translation systems like Google Translate or pre-trained translation models.

Cross-Lingual Embeddings: Another approach involves using word embeddings or document embeddings that are trained to capture semantic information across multiple languages. Examples include mBERT (Multilingual BERT) and LASER (Language-Agnostic Sentence Representations).

Parallel Corpora: Utilizing parallel corpora (collections of texts in multiple languages with aligned translations) to learn cross-lingual representations can be effective. Models can be trained to map similar text representations in different languages closer together.

Multilingual Models: Pre-trained multilingual models like mBERT, XLM-R, and others can be fine-tuned for specific cross-lingual similarity tasks. These models are designed to understand and work with multiple languages simultaneously.

*Applications of cross lingual similarity*:-
Cross-lingual text similarity has applications in information retrieval, document clustering, plagiarism detection, and machine translation evaluation
