# Cross-Lingual-and-Multilingual-Language-Modeling:-
# **Cross lingual classification**:
-Cross-lingual classification is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves training a machine learning model to classify text or data in one language and then applying that model to classify text or data in another language, even if the model has not been specifically trained on data in the target language. This task is important because it allows NLP systems to work across multiple languages without the need to develop separate models for each language, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Here we have trained the model on Khmer language by spliting the dataset into training and test set, train the model using Dense layers, achieve an accuracy of 0.7250 on classification.

*Training phase:-*
A model is trained on a labeled dataset in a source language. This dataset contains text samples with corresponding class labels. The model learns to associate certain features or patterns in the text with the correct class labels.
The model can be a traditional machine learning algorithm or a deep learning model, such as a neural network.

*Transfer phase:-*
After training, the model can be applied to classify text in a different, target language without retraining it on a new dataset in that language.
The key challenge in cross-lingual classification is to adapt the model to understand and handle the linguistic and structural differences between the source and target languages.

**Challenges and Techniques:**

One common challenge is dealing with differences in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar between languages. Methods such as word embeddings and multilingual pre-trained models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) can help bridge these gaps.
Another challenge is handling different language scripts (e.g., Latin script, Cyrillic script, Arabic script). Unicode encoding and normalization techniques can be used to address this issue.
*Applications:-*
Cross-lingual classification is particularly useful for various applications, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic categorization, and more, in multilingual or cross-cultural contexts

**key points:-** 
If the script of Some languages are somewhere similary to each other in some manner than in that case if we train model on one language and check the classification accuracy on the other language having script then this accuracy is greater than the accuracy when we train and evaluate the model on languages having somewhere different script.
# **Cross lingual text Similarity:-**
Cross-lingual text similarity is the task of measuring the similarity or similarity score between two pieces of text written in different languages. This is a valuable task in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval because it allows us to compare and find relationships between text documents in different languages. Here are some key aspects and techniques related to cross-lingual text similarity:

*Challenges in cross lingual text similarity:-*
Vocabulary Differences: Different languages have distinct vocabularies, which can make direct word matching ineffective.
Structural Differences: Syntax and grammar vary across languages, affecting sentence and document structure.
Semantic Variability: Words or phrases in one language may not have exact equivalents in another, leading to differences in meaning.

*Techniques for Cross-lingual text similarity:-*
Translation-Based Approaches: One common approach is to translate text from one language to another and then apply monolingual text similarity techniques. This can be done using machine translation systems like Google Translate or pre-trained translation models.

Cross-Lingual Embeddings: Another approach involves using word embeddings or document embeddings that are trained to capture semantic information across multiple languages. Examples include mBERT (Multilingual BERT) and LASER (Language-Agnostic Sentence Representations).

Parallel Corpora: Utilizing parallel corpora (collections of texts in multiple languages with aligned translations) to learn cross-lingual representations can be effective. Models can be trained to map similar text representations in different languages closer together.

Multilingual Models: Pre-trained multilingual models like mBERT, XLM-R, and others can be fine-tuned for specific cross-lingual similarity tasks. These models are designed to understand and work with multiple languages simultaneously.

*Applications of cross lingual similarity*:-
Cross-lingual text similarity has applications in information retrieval, document clustering, plagiarism detection, and machine translation evaluation
